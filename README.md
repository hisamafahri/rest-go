## Go Rest API

This rest API is intended to harness my own skill on Go language and its environment. Feel free to modify or reshare this repository.

## Guide

Make sure you have [installed PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database in your machine. After you have installed postgresql, please [create a database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-createdatabase.html). After that, create a `.env` file in the root of this project which contain values just like in the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file.
